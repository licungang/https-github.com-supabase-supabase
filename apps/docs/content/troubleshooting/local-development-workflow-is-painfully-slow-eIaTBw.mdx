Maybe I'm doing this wrong but the workflow of making a single change to SQL and applying it to the local database takes forever.

1. Make change to a SQL file
1. `supabase db reset`
1. Wait for 21 seconds while looking at `Restarting containers...` ( I actually timed that with a stop watch)

Meanwhile, if you have a tool like pgadmin open, you need to renavigate to the table affected to see the changes as the entire database has been wiped and re-inited. If I try to use Supabase Studio, it's just as bad because I have my data in a different schema than public, and I have to scroll a million schemas in the menu to find. It's very tedious.

Perhaps I'm doing it all wrong, or is this everyone else's DX as well?
