This error happens due to a missing parameter that needs to be set to disabled.

There are few ways to disable the "gssencmode" parameter:

1. Connection configuration file.

- [ add gssencmode = 'disable'] to your configuration file

2. In pgAdmin, when registering a server.

- [ Go to Parameters ]
- [ Click the + button ]
- [ From the dropdown, select 'GSS encmode' ]
- [ Set the value to 'disable' ]
- [ Fill out all required connection details then save ]
