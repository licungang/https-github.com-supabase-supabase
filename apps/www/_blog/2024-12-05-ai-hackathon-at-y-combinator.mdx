We hosted 150 hackers at [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com) in San Francisco for a whole weekend of hacking on AI.

Folks flew in from all around the world, including Greece, Australia, and South Africa. Students from many of the top universities in the US traveled to attend as well.

We kicked things off on Friday, and by Saturday afternoon, 47 projects were ready to demo. A panel of Supabase team members and YC founders judged the semifinals.

10 teams were chosen for the finals. YC Partner [Jared Friedman](https://x.com/snowmaker), YC Visiting Partner [Eli Brown](https://x.com/iechoic), [Copple](https://x.com/kiwicopple), and [Ant](https://x.com/AntWilson) judged the finals. Ultimately, the judges awarded the following teams:

### **Overall Winner - Soshi**

A Twitter assistant that browses and generates replies based on your niche to help you grow your Twitter following.  
_Elijah Muraoka, Michael Long, Soumil Rathi, Veer Doshi_

### **Most Entertaining - Dropout**

Dropping out of college is a badge of honor for many founders. Use this app to find potential cofounders or hires that are still in college that you could convince to drop out.  
_David Head, Kevin Fu, Jake Schwartz_

### **Most Technically Impressive - Explainstein**

Upload your homework and have a video call with your AI Tutor.  
_Finn Metz, Sricharan Guddanti, Sveinung Myhre_

### **Most Novel Use of Supabase - Suparova**

A Supabase-powered [rover](https://www.amazon.com/HIWONDER-Raspberry-Vision-Mecanum-Progamming/dp/B0CCYKGQZB) that can speak, recognize faces, and, most importantly, dance!  
_Kwindla Kramer, Simon Sturmer, Bassim Eledath_

Thanks to everyone that attended, [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com) for providing Claude credits to all the teams, and Y Combinator for hosting us. See you next time!
